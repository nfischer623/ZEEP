## Requirements

What you'll need:
* Windows 10 or higher
* Java 17 or higher

If you're unsure if you have Java installed, or you want to check which version you have, [open a command prompt](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-Terminal-in-Windows) and enter the command `java --version`.

If you do not have a sufficient Java installation, you can [download the latest Java release for free from Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk24-windows).
If you're not sure which Windows installation to download, we recommend the x64 Installer or x64 MSI Installer, as these will guide you through the process of installation without having to unzip anything.
Any version of the JDK (e.g. 24, 21, etc.) is fine, as long as it is 17 or higher.

## How to Run

1. Download the latest release JAR (currently ZEEPv1.2.jar) from the [Releases](https://github.com/nfischer623/ZEEP/releases) page.
2. Double-click the JAR file to open ZEEP!

If you try to run the JAR file and nothing happens/a window shows up for a split second but immediately disappears:
1. [Open a command prompt.](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-Terminal-in-Windows)
2. Enter the following command:  
`java --jar <path-to-file>`  
Replace `<path-to-file>` with the path to the ZEEP JAR. For example, if the JAR is in your Downloads folder, your path may look like `C:\Users\nicole\Downloads\ZEEPv1.2.jar` or just `Downloads\ZEEPv1.2.jar`.

If ZEEP did not run before, it should now!
